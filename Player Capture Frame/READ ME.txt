I used the dll freeware CapStill.dll to capture frames. You found the DLL at this link:
http://www.gdcl.co.uk/index.htm. Supported and Captured movie format:
*.avi;*.asf;*.mpg;*.mpeg;*.wmv;*.divx;*.dat;*.mpx;*mkv;*.mov;*.vob
Don't forget to register the DLL CapStill.dll and adding a reference to this library
before running the project! Also adding the reference 'Microsoft Active Movie Control Library'...
